This code was developed by Library and Archives Canada. It builds on the foundation created by OranguTech that can be found on codeplex. It applies the WET 3.0 framework. Our intention is to keep the source code up to date with the latest major versions of the WET, skipping minor versions if they don't implicitely fix a known problem with the SharePoint variant. The active source code is not this GitHub repository, but a TFS Online repository on Microsoft's servers. If you'd like to be granted access, please contact Nikolas.Charlebois-Laprade@LAC-BAC.gc.ca We currently have members from ACOA, and NSERC participating as well.
